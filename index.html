        I am learning computer Science at the <a href="http://www.salford.ac.uk"> University of Salford</a> .
        I decided to study my course at Salford because : is one of leading University in the field of computer Science.
     </p>
     <p>
       My course is provided by the School of Computing, Science &amp;
       Engineering, which is based in the Newton Building. The Newton Building was not build recently, and would benefit
       from same improvement. If I had to make a decision on how salve the issue I would : I would demolish and rebuilt from scratch.
       The School's Web site is <a href="http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk"> School of Computing Science &amp; Engineering</a>
